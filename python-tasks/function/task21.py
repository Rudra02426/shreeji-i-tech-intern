### Task 21: Function vs Lambda

#normal func

def sqr(n):
	return n*n

#lambda func

squr= lambda n : n*n

print("square with normal function is:", sqr(4))
print("square with lambda function is :", squr(4))


#explaination == lambda written in single line and easy to use compare to normal fun but result is same in both
